# Contributing to EPUB Media Overlay Editor

Thank you for your interest in contributing! As mentioned in the README, this project exists because I needed it to work. Here are some guidelines for contributing:

## Development Philosophy

This is a personal tool that solved a specific problem. I'm a writer first, developer second, so please keep that context in mind.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Test your changes** with your own EPUB files
5. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
6. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. **Open a Pull Request**

## What I'm Looking For

- Bug fixes for common EPUB formats
- Performance improvements
- Better error handling
- UI/UX improvements
- Documentation improvements

## What I Can't Promise

- Quick review times (I have a day job writing books)
- Compatibility with every EPUB format under the sun
- Enterprise-level features
- Ongoing maintenance

## Testing

Before submitting a PR, please test with at least one EPUB file that has media overlays. The tool is designed for EPUBs that already have some sync data.

## Code Style

The project uses ESLint and TypeScript. Run `npm run lint` before submitting.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue, but please understand that "it doesn't work with my specific EPUB" might not get immediate attention.

Thanks for understanding the constraints and still wanting to help improve this tool!
